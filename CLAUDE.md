## Architecture

Serverless email sequencing framework on AWS. Product-agnostic: the framework defines contracts for event ingestion, subscriber management, template rendering, and sequence execution. Users provide their own sequences (Step Functions state machines), templates (React Email → HTML), and events.

### Monorepo packages (pnpm workspaces)

- **`shared`** - Types and constants consumed by handlers and CDK. Must build first. Exports key helpers like `subscriberPK()`, `executionSK()`, `sentSK()` for DynamoDB key construction.
- **`handlers`** - Five Lambda functions + shared lib modules. All handlers read config from Lambda environment variables (via `lib/config.ts`).
- **`cdk`** - AWS CDK infrastructure. Config is loaded from a root `.env` file (see `.env.example`). All config values are passed as Lambda environment variables at deploy time. Entry point: `bin/app.ts`.
- **`mcp`** - MCP server (`@mailshot/mcp`) for interacting with the email system from Claude Code. Provides tools for subscriber management, engagement analytics, template preview, and system health. Spawned over stdio, uses local AWS credentials. Setup: `claude mcp add mailshot -e AWS_PROFILE=<profile> -- npx @mailshot/mcp` (reads config from `.env`).
- **`create`** - `create-mailshot` CLI that scaffolds new user projects. Run with `npx create-mailshot my-project`. Template files are embedded in the package.

### Data flow

1. App backend publishes events to EventBridge custom bus
2. EventBridge rules route to either Step Functions (sequences) or SendEmailFn directly (fire-and-forget)
3. Step Functions state machines call SendEmailFn for register/send/complete actions
4. SendEmailFn: reads subscriber from DynamoDB → pre-send checks → fetches template from S3 → renders with LiquidJS → sends via SES (using sender config from event payload) → writes send log
5. SES bounce/complaint notifications → SNS → BounceHandlerFn → suppresses subscriber, stops executions
6. SES engagement events (delivery, open, click, bounce, complaint) → SNS → EngagementHandlerFn → writes to EmailEvents table
7. Unsubscribe link → UnsubscribeFn (Lambda Function URL, no auth) → marks unsubscribed, stops executions

### DynamoDB tables

**Main table** (single-table design): All items keyed by `PK = SUB#<email>`. Sort keys: `PROFILE`, `EXEC#<sequenceId>`, `SENT#<timestamp>`, `SUPPRESSION`. No GSIs. Subscriber attributes (platform, country, gateway, etc.) are stored as **top-level columns** on the PROFILE item - not nested under an `attributes` map. System columns (`PK`, `SK`, `email`, `firstName`, `unsubscribed`, `suppressed`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) are fixed; everything else is a dynamic attribute. Use `extractAttributes(profile)` from `dynamo-client.ts` to separate custom attributes from system columns.

**Events table** (engagement tracking): `PK = SUB#<email>`, `SK = EVT#<timestamp>#<eventType>`. GSI `TemplateIndex` on `templateKey` + `SK` for cross-subscriber template queries. Optional TTL via `DATA_TTL_DAYS` env var (disabled by default).

### Resource tags

All resources in the stack are tagged automatically via `cdk.Tags.of(this)` in `MailshotStack`:

- `application: mailshot` — identifies mailshot-created resources across the AWS account
- `stack: <STACK_NAME>` — identifies which deployment owns the resource

These tags can be activated as **cost allocation tags** in AWS Billing to track per-stack costs in Cost Explorer.

### CDK constructs (in `lib/constructs/`)

- **storage** - DynamoDB main table + events table + S3 template bucket + BucketDeployment
- **lambdas** - Five NodejsFunction Lambdas with esbuild bundling (AWS SDK externalized). Config passed as environment variables
- **ses-config** - SES configuration set + SNS topics for bounce/complaint and engagement events. Creates SES receipt rules for sequences with `captureReplies: true`
- **state-machines** - Step Functions definitions (auto-discovered from sequences)
- **event-bus** - Custom EventBridge bus + routing rules

### Handler lib modules

- **config** - Resolves all config from Lambda environment variables
- **dynamo-client** - All DynamoDB operations (profile CRUD, execution tracking, send log, suppression). Exports `extractAttributes(profile)` to separate custom attributes from system columns
- **template-renderer** - S3 fetch + LiquidJS render with 10min cache
- **ses-sender** - SES v2 SendEmail with List-Unsubscribe headers. `templateKey` and `sequenceId` are sent as custom headers (`X-Template-Key`, `X-Sequence-Id`) for engagement tracking, and as SES EmailTags (with `/` replaced by `--` in tag values since SES doesn't allow `/` in tags)
- **unsubscribe-token** - HMAC-SHA256 token generation/validation (90-day expiry)
- **display-names** - Optional value→display name mappings loaded from S3
- **execution-stopper** - Stops all Step Functions executions for a subscriber

### Per-sequence sender config

Each sequence defines its own sender identity in `sequence.config.ts` via the `sender` field on `SequenceDefinition`:

- `fromEmail` (required) - the SES-verified address to send from
- `fromName` (required) - display name in the "From" field
- `replyToEmail` (optional) - Reply-To header address
- `captureReplies` (optional) - when `true`, CDK creates an SES receipt rule for `replyToEmail` to capture inbound replies via SNS → ReplyHandlerFn. Use for SES-managed inboxes (e.g., cold outreach). Leave unset when reply-to is a normal email address
- `forwardRepliesTo` (optional) - when set alongside `captureReplies`, forwards captured replies to this email address via SES. The `From:` header is rewritten to the verified `replyToEmail` with `Reply-To:` set to the original sender, so you can reply directly back
- `listUnsubscribe` (optional, default: `true`) - when `false`, omits `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers. Use for cold outreach where these headers signal bulk mail to Gmail. The `unsubscribeUrl` template variable is still available for in-body links

Sender config is baked into Step Functions payloads at deploy time (static, not dynamic). The SendEmailFn reads `sender` from the event payload, not from environment variables. There are no project-level sender defaults — every sequence must define its own.

### A/B testing

Send steps support `variants` for A/B testing. Instead of a single `templateKey`/`subject`, provide an array of variants:

```typescript
{
  type: "send",
  variants: [
    { templateKey: "onboarding/welcome-a", subject: "Welcome aboard!" },
    { templateKey: "onboarding/welcome-b", subject: "Hey, welcome!" },
  ],
}
```

Variant assignment is deterministic — `SHA-256(email + sequenceId)` picks the same variant for a subscriber across all steps in a sequence. Each variant uses a distinct `templateKey`, so engagement stats (opens, clicks, bounces) are automatically tracked per variant via the existing `TemplateIndex` GSI on the Events table.

## Key Conventions

- All packages use CommonJS (`"type": "commonjs"`) with `Node16` module resolution
- TypeScript strict mode, target ES2022, Node 22 runtime
- Imports between workspace packages use `@mailshot/<pkg>` with `.js` extensions
- CDK uses `NodejsFunction` - handlers are bundled with esbuild at deploy time, AWS SDK is externalized
- Pre-send check failures (unsubscribed, suppressed, rate-limited) return `{ sent: false }` - they don't throw. Sequences continue, emails are skipped.
- The `unsubscribed` and `suppressed` flags on subscriber profiles are never overwritten by upsert - only their respective handlers can set them to `true`
- Subscriber attributes are top-level DynamoDB columns, not nested under an `attributes` map. The `Subscriber` type (event input) still has `attributes?: Record<string, unknown>` - these are flattened to top-level columns on write, with system keys filtered out
- `AWS_PROFILE` is set in `.env` and must be passed to CDK commands and the MCP server. The MCP server reads `.env` automatically for table/bucket names
- SES EmailTags don't allow `/` in values - `templateKey` is stored with `/` replaced by `--` in tags only. Headers and DynamoDB use the original key with `/`
- Commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format (enforced by commitlint). Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`

## Versioning & Change Management

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management and automated changelog generation. Core packages (shared, handlers, cdk, mcp, create-mailshot) are **linked** - they always version together. All packages are published to npm as public packages.

### When to create a changeset

Create a changeset for any code change that affects package behavior - features, fixes, refactors, breaking changes. Skip changesets for docs-only, CI, or tooling changes that don't affect package code.

### How to create a changeset (non-interactive, for AI use)

The `pnpm changeset` command is interactive and cannot be used by AI. Instead, write a changeset file directly to `.changeset/`:

```bash
# File: .changeset/<descriptive-kebab-name>.md
# Example: .changeset/add-rate-limit-headers.md
```

**File format:**

```markdown
---
"@mailshot/handlers": minor
"@mailshot/shared": minor
---

Add rate limit headers to SES sender responses
```

**Rules for the YAML frontmatter:**

- List every package that was changed (by its `name` from `package.json`)
- Bump type per package: `patch` (bug fixes), `minor` (new features, non-breaking), `major` (breaking changes)
- Linked packages (shared, handlers, cdk, mcp, create-mailshot) will all get the highest bump among them
- The `@mailshot/tools` package is ignored by changesets

**Rules for the summary (below the `---`):**

- One concise line describing the change from a user/consumer perspective
- Use imperative mood ("Add...", "Fix...", "Remove...")
- This text appears verbatim in the CHANGELOG.md

### Bump type guide

| Change type                                                 | Bump    | Examples                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Bug fix, typo, minor correction                             | `patch` | Fix SES tag encoding, fix DynamoDB key format      |
| New feature, new handler, new config option                 | `minor` | Add engagement tracking, add display name mappings |
| Breaking API/type change, removed feature, schema migration | `major` | Change Subscriber type shape, rename env var keys  |

### Applying changesets (releasing)

```bash
pnpm version-packages    # Consumes all .changeset/*.md files, bumps versions in package.json, updates CHANGELOG.md
pnpm release             # version-packages + build + publish to npm
```

After `version-packages` runs, the `.changeset/*.md` files are deleted and the version bumps + changelog entries are staged. Commit this as a release commit (e.g., `chore: release v0.2.0`).

### Example workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Write `.changeset/my-change.md` with affected packages and bump types
3. Commit everything together: `feat: add rate limit headers`
4. When ready to release: `pnpm version-packages` → commit → deploy
