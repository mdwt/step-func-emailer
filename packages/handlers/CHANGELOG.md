# @mailshot/handlers

## 1.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [`fd689ab`](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/commit/fd689ab6efff34fd9b5bea145d20a36c3f2e8a10) Thanks [@mdwt](https://github.com/mdwt)! - Publish Claude Code skills as a dedicated `@mailshot/skills` package. Scaffolded projects now refresh `.claude/skills/` automatically on `pnpm install` (postinstall hook), so framework upgrades keep skills in sync without manual steps. New `sync_skills` MCP tool exposes the same code path. The framework repo's root `.claude/skills/` is now a symlink to the canonical source so contributors can no longer drift from the user-facing copies.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`fd689ab`](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/commit/fd689ab6efff34fd9b5bea145d20a36c3f2e8a10)]:

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [`469a296`](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/commit/469a2969581ab3a4c2455e9c8d32a104d34817b4) Thanks [@mdwt](https://github.com/mdwt)! - Add `list_sequence_subscribers` MCP tool to show subscribers currently active in a sequence. `putExecution` now writes an inverted sequence-side row (`PK = EXEC#<sequenceId>, SK = SUB#<email>`) atomically via `TransactWriteItems` (following the existing TagItem pattern); `deleteExecution` cleans up both rows. `list_sequences` now includes `activeExecutionCount` per sequence. New `/inspect-sequence` bootstrap skill bundles active subscribers, recent engagement, and recent failures into one read-only inspection workflow.

  **Upgrading existing bootstrapped projects:**
  1. **MCP tools** — `list_sequence_subscribers` and the enriched `list_sequences` are available the next time `npx @mailshot/mcp` spawns. Just restart Claude Code.
  2. **Dual-row writes** — The new MCP tool returns empty until you redeploy, because the inverted EXEC rows are produced by the handler code that ships in this version. Bump deps and redeploy:
     ```bash
     pnpm up @mailshot/handlers @mailshot/cdk @mailshot/shared
     pnpm install
     /deploy
     ```
  3. **`/inspect-sequence` skill** — Skills are scaffolded once at `npx create-mailshot` time and don't auto-update. To add it to an existing project, copy the file from the [v1.7.0 template](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/tree/main/packages/create/template/_claude/skills/inspect-sequence) into `.claude/skills/inspect-sequence/SKILL.md`.
  4. **In-flight executions** — EXEC items written before the redeploy only have the subscriber-side row and won't appear in the inspector until they complete and a new execution starts. The gap is bounded by each sequence's `timeoutMinutes`.

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#6](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/pull/6) [`ab62305`](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/commit/ab62305303faa30847d9210749ab78953060f5c8) Thanks [@mdwt](https://github.com/mdwt)! - Add broadcast email support with tag-based subscriber filtering and SQS fan-out

- [`53115a3`](https://github.com/mdwt/mailshot/commit/53115a3bd4a905c097923873261006e390978f14) Thanks [@mdwt](https://github.com/mdwt)! - Rename `BroadcastRecord.subscriberCount` to `audienceSize` and add live engagement counters (`deliveryCount`, `openCount`, `clickCount`, `bounceCount`, `complaintCount`) maintained on a separate `STATS#<sequenceId>/COUNTERS` item by `EngagementHandlerFn`. Counters are merged into `get_broadcast` and `list_broadcasts` responses automatically. The same item also accumulates lifetime stats for sequences as a side benefit.
