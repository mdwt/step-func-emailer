# Create Sequence

Create a complete email sequence from a natural language description — generates a sequence config, React Email templates, and render script. Zero framework code changes needed. The CDK auto-discovers sequences from `sequences/*/sequence.config.ts`.

## Usage

```
/create-sequence <description of your email sequence>
```

Example: `/create-sequence A trial expiring sequence triggered by trial.expiring — send a "trial ending soon" email immediately, then a "last chance" email after 2 days, then a "trial expired" email after 3 more days`

## Instructions

You are generating all the code needed to deploy a new email sequence. Follow this workflow exactly.

### Step 1: Parse the input

Extract from the user's description:

- **sequenceId** — unique kebab-case ID (e.g., `trial-expiring`, `onboarding`)
- **triggerEvent** — EventBridge detail-type (e.g., `trial.expiring`, `customer.created`)
- **subscriberMapping** — how to extract subscriber fields from the event (defaults to `$.detail.email`, `$.detail.firstName`, `$.detail` for attributes)
- **timeoutMinutes** — how long the Step Function execution can run before timing out
- **emails** — ordered list, each with:
  - `templateName` — kebab-case slug (e.g., `trial-ending-soon`)
  - `subject` — email subject line
  - `previewText` — preview/preheader text
  - `body` — paragraphs and content for the email body
  - `delayBefore` — delay before this email (`0` for immediate, or e.g. `2 days`, `1 week`)
- **branching** (optional) — any choice/condition logic (e.g., "different welcome email per platform", "skip if already sent")
- **events** (optional) — one-off fire-and-forget emails triggered by events during the sequence (e.g., "send congrats on first sale")

If any of these are missing or ambiguous, ask the user to clarify before generating code. Present your parsed interpretation to the user and confirm before proceeding.

### Step 2: Create the sequence folder

Create `sequences/<sequenceId>/` with the following files. Pay attention to exact file paths.

**`sequences/<sequenceId>/package.json`:**

```json
{
  "name": "@mailshot/<sequenceId>",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "private": true,
  "type": "commonjs",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && pnpm render",
    "render": "tsx src/render.ts",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "dev": "email dev --dir src/emails --port 3002",
    "test": "vitest run",
    "lint": "tsc --noEmit"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@react-email/components": "^1.0.9",
    "react": "^19.2.4",
    "react-dom": "^19.2.4"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@react-email/render": "^2.0.4",
    "@mailshot/shared": "^0.2.0",
    "@types/node": "^22.0.0",
    "@types/react": "^19.2.14",
    "@types/react-dom": "^19.2.3",
    "react-email": "^5.2.9",
    "tsx": "^4.21.0"
  }
}
```

**`sequences/<sequenceId>/tsconfig.json`:**

```json
{
  "extends": "../../tsconfig.base.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src",
    "jsx": "react-jsx"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

### Step 3: Create `sequence.config.ts`

**CRITICAL:** This file MUST be at `sequences/<sequenceId>/sequence.config.ts` — NOT inside `src/`. CDK auto-discovers sequences by looking for `sequences/*/sequence.config.ts` at the sequence root. If it's inside `src/`, CDK won't find it and no state machine will be created.

The config must satisfy the `SequenceDefinition` type from `@mailshot/shared`. Here is the full shape:

```typescript
import type { SequenceDefinition } from "@mailshot/shared";

export default {
  id: "<sequenceId>",
  trigger: {
    detailType: "<triggerEvent>",
    subscriberMapping: {
      email: "$.detail.email",
      firstName: "$.detail.firstName",
      attributes: "$.detail",
    },
  },
  timeoutMinutes: 43200,
  steps: [
    // ... step objects (see below)
  ],
  // Optional: fire-and-forget emails triggered by events during the sequence
  events: [
    {
      detailType: "customer.first_sale",
      templateKey: "<sequenceId>/first-sale",
      subject: "Congrats!",
    },
  ],
} satisfies SequenceDefinition;
```

#### Step types

**Send** — sends an email via the SendEmailFn Lambda:

```typescript
{ type: "send", templateKey: "<sequenceId>/<templateName>", subject: "..." }
```

**Wait** — pauses the Step Function execution:

```typescript
{ type: "wait", days: 2 }
{ type: "wait", hours: 12 }
{ type: "wait", minutes: 30 }
```

**Choice** — native Step Functions branching on a field in the execution input. No Lambda invocation — evaluated directly in the state machine. Use this for branching on subscriber attributes passed in via the event:

```typescript
{
  type: "choice",
  field: "$.subscriber.attributes.plan",
  branches: [
    { value: "pro", steps: [{ type: "send", templateKey: "...", subject: "..." }] },
    { value: "free", steps: [{ type: "send", templateKey: "...", subject: "..." }] },
  ],
  default: [{ type: "send", templateKey: "...", subject: "..." }],
}
```

Choices can be nested (e.g., branch on platform, then on country within each platform). All branches converge automatically — steps after a choice run for all branches.

**Condition** — Lambda-based check that queries DynamoDB. Use this only when the data isn't in the execution input (e.g., checking send history or subscriber profile fields that changed after the sequence started):

```typescript
{
  type: "condition",
  check: "has_been_sent",
  templateKey: "<sequenceId>/<templateName>",
  then: [],  // skip
  else: [{ type: "send", templateKey: "...", subject: "..." }],
}
```

Available checks:

- `has_been_sent` — requires `templateKey`. True if the subscriber has already been sent this template.
- `subscriber_field_exists` — requires `field`. True if the field exists on the subscriber's DynamoDB profile attributes.
- `subscriber_field_equals` — requires `field` and `value`. True if the profile attribute matches the value.

**When to use `choice` vs `condition`:** Use `choice` for branching on data that's available in the execution input (subscriber attributes from the triggering event). Use `condition` only when you need to query DynamoDB at runtime (send history, profile changes after sequence start).

### Step 4: Generate React Email templates

For each email, create a file at `sequences/<sequenceId>/src/emails/<templateName>.tsx`.

If using React Email:

- Import from `@react-email/components`
- Use Liquid placeholders: `firstName` and `unsubscribeUrl` as props with defaults
- Include `<Preview>` with preheader text
- Include unsubscribe link in footer

### Step 5: Create render script

Create `sequences/<sequenceId>/src/render.ts`. The `OUT_DIR` MUST use `__dirname` to resolve relative to the file, not `process.cwd()` (which changes depending on how the script is invoked):

```typescript
const OUT_DIR = path.join(__dirname, "../../../build/<sequenceId>/templates");
```

This resolves to `build/<sequenceId>/templates/` at the project root regardless of working directory.

### Step 6: Install and verify

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @mailshot/<sequenceId> build
npx cdk synth
```

All commands must succeed before the skill is complete.

### What you do NOT need to edit

- CDK infrastructure files — sequences are auto-discovered from `sequences/*/sequence.config.ts`
