            I wanted to share what some of our customers are doing with CheckoutJoy — might spark
            some ideas for your setup.
          </Text>

          <Text style={paragraph}>
            Course creators in South Africa, India, and the Philippines are using CheckoutJoy to
            accept local payments on Kajabi, Thinkific, and Teachable. Some are processing hundreds
            of transactions per month that they couldn't have accepted before.
          </Text>

          <Text style={paragraph}>
            The most successful ones all have one thing in common: they set up their checkout and
            sent traffic within the first week.
          </Text>

          <Text style={paragraph}>
            If you haven't made a test purchase yet, that's a great next step. Set up a test
            product, run through the checkout yourself, and make sure everything works before you
            send real traffic.
